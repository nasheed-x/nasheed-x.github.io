## hello!
my name's nasheed. i'm a junior studying electrical engineering & computer science at nyu’s tandon school of engineering.

i enjoy solving challenging problems, combining different tools, and exploring multiple domains to arrive at elegant solutions. this website should help illustrate some of my past and current works. 

(there's also a blog, but i haven't pushed myself hard enough to write something worth reading—so here's a link to some of [paul graham's](https://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html) amazing essays for now.)
