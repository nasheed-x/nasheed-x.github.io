hello! i'm a junior studying electrical engineering & computer science at nyu's tandon school of engineering.

i enjoy solving challenging problems, seamlessly combining different tools, and exploring multiple domains to arrive at elegant answers.

i stumbuled into hobbyist rocketry and helped set up [nyuad.space](https://nyuad-space.github.io/). we've been working on revolutionizing high-powered rocketry and have channeled our aspirations into [haloship](https://nyuad-space.github.io/projects/haloship/), our entry to the 2023 spaceport america cup. we're also collaborating with nasa's jet propulsion lab to propose a novel, field-resettable, reusable, and redundant [hold down release mechanism (hdrm)](https://nyuad-space.github.io/projects/hdrm/).

find my code on [github](https://github.com/nasheed-x).
