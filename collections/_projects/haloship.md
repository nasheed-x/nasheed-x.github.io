title: "Haloship"
description: "a reusable experimental sounding rocket featuring a dual redundant parachute release system."

blurb: "Haloship is a fully reusable high-powered rocket designed without external screws, shear-pins, or epoxy. Its internal substructures are entirely mechanical, complemented by a mechanically and electronically redundant parachute deployment system called the Hold Down & Release Mechanism (HDRM). The rocket features Student Research and Developed Avionics, including a custom flight computer and high-speed data acquisition payload. <br><br> Representing nyuad.space in the 2023 Spaceport America Cup, Haloship aimed to demonstrate innovative possibilities in high-powered rocketry. It successfully completed its test flight on June 24th, 2023, securing 2nd place for the Dr. Gil Moore Award for Innovation."

### Launch Video

Here's a video capturing the launch event. Despite our initial plan to launch on day 2, unforeseen factors necessitated a reschedule to day 4. This adjustment was prompted by last-minute troubleshooting (murphy's law at play) and unpredictable weather conditions.

The cameraman does a decent job tracking the rocket for the most part but loses focus right before the main chute deployment event. Beyond the actual launch, not much was visible to us from the ground.
