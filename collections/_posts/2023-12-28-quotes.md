i started gathering these quotes during my freshman year, drawing inspiration from the collection of [engineering quotes](https://nyuad.io/en/resources/engineering-quotes) at nyu abu dhabi's engineering design studio. i observed how these phrases, philosophies, and concepts consistently resonate throughout the field of engineering, eloquently describing the functioning world around us in captivating ways.

if you've got time to spare, they're worth taking a look at:

  — **Pervez Amirali Hoodbhoy**

  — **Glib's Fourth Law of Unreliability**

- “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness...”
  
  — **Carl Sagan**

- “There is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it. And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment.”
  
  — **John F. Kennedy**

- “From indoctrination's foul rope  
  Suspend all reason, all hope  
  Until with swollen tongue  
  Morality herself is hung.”
  
  — **Pervez Amirali Hoodbhoy**

- “The amount of energy necessary to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it.”
  
  — **Paul Kedrosky**

- “The fear of infinity is a form of myopia that destroys the possibility of seeing the actual infinite...”
  
  — **Georg Cantor**

- “It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.”
  
  — **Aristotle**

- “Obsessed is just a word the lazy use to describe the dedicated.”
  
  — **Russell Warren**

  — **Chaos Theory**

  — **Jorge Luis Borges**
